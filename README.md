For the client The Gaming Room, they wanted their game, Draw it or Lose it, to be available on multiple operating systems like WindowsOS MacOS and LinuxOS. To do so I put together a proposal showing different options and what would be required for each of those options. The documents strengths are with its level of information given. Each description was brief yet detailed informing and educating the clients. One area of improvement would be my understanding of LinuxOS. Due to my lack of experience and bias I could only recommend Windows, so I should have done a more thorough job of research and testing to give a less biased recommendation.

Understanding what the user wanted in a clear consie manner made the development easier and more thorough. By understanding the clients desires and the means they are willing to go through to obtain those desires allowed me to formulate a plan in which I could use tactics well known by me to deliver. Understanding the user's needs is also beneficial by allowing me to develop certain devices or use certain tools that are'nt know by the client, allowing me to fully deliver.
